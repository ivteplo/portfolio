      <p>
        Hi, I'm Ivan Teplov. I'm a software engineer living in Vinnytsia, Ukraine.
        I currently study in a High School and develop websites and apps.

      <p>
        I've been programming since 10 years old, and I never stop learning
        latest technologies and exploring the world of computers. Coding is my
        passion, and I always try to improve myself to make high-quality websites,
        apps, or other tech-related products.
